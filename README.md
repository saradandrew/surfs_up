# Surfs Up Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to obtain more information on temperature trends for the months of June and December before opening up the shop in Oahu, HI. This information will be used to determine if the surf shop and ice cream business is sustainable year-round. 

## Results
Three major points from the analysis:
- The average temperature in Oahu in June is 74.9 degrees.


- The average temperature in Oahu in December is 71 degrees.


- For both June and December, the max temperature is over 80 degrees. For June, the minimum temperature is 64 degrees while the minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees. 

## Summary
From this analysis, I can conclude that the surf shop and ice cream shop is likely to be sustainable year-round since the average temperature for both months is above 70 degrees. An additional query I would perform to gather more weather data for the months of June and December would be to count the number of days that the temperature fell below average temperature. I would also perform another query to count the amount of times the temperature rose above the average temperature. These queries would help get an idea of how many times we could expect the temperature to be closer to the minimum temperature and maximum temperatures than the average temperature. Furthermore, it would be helpful to find the freqencies of the temperatures.
